This was a simple experiment to get various family members mug shots onto a webpage - each mugshot is composed of 9 shots, one for each point on the compass.  As the user moves the mouse the faces follow the pointer.

On mobile the faces snap to the point the user clicks.

TODO:
- Experiment with taking photos with the webcamera, if available.
- extract the face component into it's own library.  It will take 8 photos as props.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
